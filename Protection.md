# Branch Protection Rules for PolishPro: Nail Salon Booking System

In order to maintain code quality, security, and collaboration standards, we have implemented branch protection rules for the `main` branch of the **PolishPro** repository. The `main` branch represents the stable and production-ready version of the project. The protection rules are designed to ensure that all changes to the main codebase are thoroughly reviewed and tested before merging.

## Why These Rules Matter

### 1. **Require Pull Request Reviews (at least 1)**

- **Purpose:** Ensures that every change made to the code is reviewed by at least one other developer before it is merged.
- **Benefit:** Code reviews help in identifying bugs, improving code quality, and ensuring that the changes align with the project’s overall goals. They also allow for knowledge sharing within the team.

### 2. **Require Status Checks to Pass (CI Workflow)**

- **Purpose:** Prevents the merging of code that has not passed necessary tests and continuous integration checks.
- **Benefit:** Automates the process of ensuring that the code runs correctly and doesn’t break existing functionality. It enforces consistency by running unit tests, integration tests, and other checks that validate the code quality.

### 3. **Require Branches to Be Up-to-Date Before Merging**

- **Purpose:** Ensures that the branch being merged into `main` is up to date with the latest changes from the main branch before merging.
- **Benefit:** This rule helps avoid merge conflicts and ensures that the changes are based on the most current version of the code. It improves the reliability of the integration and minimizes disruptions to ongoing work.

### 4. **Disable Direct Pushes (All Changes Must Go Through PRs)**

- **Purpose:** Ensures that all changes to the main codebase are reviewed and approved via a pull request, preventing unreviewed code from being pushed directly to the main branch.
- **Benefit:** This rule ensures a structured workflow and helps maintain the integrity of the main branch. It prevents accidental changes or mistakes from being pushed without review.

### Conclusion

The **branch protection rules** applied to the `main` branch of **PolishPro** are critical for maintaining code quality, enforcing team collaboration, and automating checks that ensure the stability and reliability of the application. These rules help to prevent errors and maintain a robust development workflow that minimizes the risk of breaking production-ready code.
