### Project Title: 
**ðŸ’… PolishPro: Nail Salon Booking System**

## Domain
**Beauty and Wellness**

The Beauty and Wellness industry has a variety of services that target clients' personal grooming, wellness, and overall health. Nail salons, spas, gyms, and beauty treatment services are some of the businesses in this industry. The Nail Salon Booking System falls under the Beauty and Wellness industry, and it provides an online solution to assist in automating the booking system for clients in need of nail care services. The system addresses common problems for small businesses in the beauty industry.

## Problem Statement
A small nail salon business currently uses WhatsApp for appointments and inquiries about services provided, which has become increasingly challenging for the owner to manage as the client base grows. The manual scheduling process has led to many operational issues such as double booking due to inadequate communication of available time slots, missed messages, and delayed responses, causing frustration to the customers. Additionally, tracking customer history is challenging since there is no central repository for past appointments or preferences, making it hard to offer personalized service. The new web application aims to streamline the booking process, allowing clients to easily book, view services that the nail salon provides, receive reminders and confirmations and be able to control their bookings by rescheduling or cancelling as needed. By addressing these issues, it will improve overall efficiency of the salon business.
