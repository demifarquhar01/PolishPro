# üìù Sprint Reflection: Challenges in Prioritization, Estimation, and Agile Alignment  

## üìå Overview  
Developing the **PolishPro: Nail Salon Booking System** alone has been a unique experience. Without a team to provide feedback or distribute tasks, I found myself facing internal struggles in **prioritization, estimation, and aligning Agile** to my workflow. Agile thrives in team environments where collaboration helps refine requirements, but as a solo developer, I had to adjust the framework to fit my needs.  

This reflection explores the biggest challenges I faced in this sprint and how I overcame them.  

## üî• Challenges Faced  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Prioritization Struggles: What Comes First?**  
One of the toughest challenges was **deciding what to prioritize** in the first sprint. Since the system requires multiple key features‚Äîbooking management, user authentication, email notifications, and more‚ÄîI found myself tempted to work on everything at once. However, that approach **contradicts Agile principles**, which emphasize delivering incremental value.  

Initially, I considered starting with **user accounts** since authentication is important, but I realized that without a booking system, the application wouldn‚Äôt serve its core purpose. Ultimately, I decided to **focus Sprint 1 on core booking functionality**‚Äîallowing users to select services, schedule appointments, and receive confirmation emails.  

- **Lesson Learned:** Prioritization isn‚Äôt just about importance; it‚Äôs about delivering **early value** to the end users. The MVP mindset helped me make this decision.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Time Estimation & Task Breakdown**  
Estimating effort was another major challenge. Since I was handling both **development and testing**, I had to determine how much time each task would take. Some tasks, like setting up the database schema, seemed simple at first but became more complex when I had to optimize relationships between tables and ensure data integrity.  

Another unexpected delay came from **email confirmation functionality**. I assumed it would take only a few hours, but setting up an email service, handling API errors, and formatting the email properly took much longer.  

- **Lesson Learned:** Task estimation should include **buffer time** for debugging, especially for features that involve third-party integration. I now realize that **technical tasks are rarely as straightforward as they seem** on paper.  

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Aligning Agile to a Solo Workflow**  
Agile methodologies typically involve **team collaboration**, stand-ups, and retrospectives. Since I don‚Äôt have a project manager or a development team, I had to **adapt Agile principles to a solo workflow**.  

- I track all my tasks using **GitHub Issues**, ensuring each sprint has a structured task breakdown.  
- I use **GitHub Milestones** to define sprint goals and track overall progress.  
- Instead of team stand-ups, I conduct **self-reviews** at the end of each sprint, reflecting on what went well and what needs improvement.  

However, without external feedback, it was easy to **overlook mistakes** or focus too much on a single aspect of the project. To counter this, I started reviewing the system **from a user‚Äôs perspective** at regular checkpoints.  

‚úÖ **Lesson Learned:** Solo Agile development requires **self-discipline** and a **structured review process** to ensure steady progress. I now incorporate **mini-retrospectives** to evaluate what‚Äôs working.  

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Managing Motivation and Focus**  
Working alone means **there‚Äôs no external accountability**, making it challenging to stay motivated.  

- Some tasks, like writing documentation, felt tedious, while others, like coding, were more engaging.  
- To stay focused, I set **clear sprint goals**, track progress using **GitHub Milestones**, and celebrate small wins after completing major features.  

‚úÖ **Lesson Learned:** Breaking work into **small, achievable tasks** and tracking them with **GitHub Issues and Milestones** keeps motivation high and ensures steady progress.  

## üéØ **Final Thoughts**  
Adapting Agile to a solo project required **prioritization, structured tracking, and self-review mechanisms**. While challenging, using **GitHub Issues and Milestones for sprint tracking** and **conducting personal retrospectives** has helped me stay organized and accountable. Moving forward, I plan to refine my **task estimation skills** and **improve system testing strategies** to enhance project efficiency. üöÄ  
## üéØ Moving Forward  
1. **Improve Estimation Accuracy** ‚Äì I will compare actual vs. estimated time to refine future estimates.  
2. **Maintain a Clear Sprint Focus** ‚Äì Each sprint will have a well-defined goal to avoid distractions.  
3. **Implement Self-Reviews** ‚Äì Reviewing the system from a fresh perspective will help catch usability issues.  

üöÄ**Despite these challenges, the sprint has been a valuable learning experience. Adapting Agile as a solo developer requires structure, but with continuous reflection, I can refine my approach and deliver a well-organized system.**
