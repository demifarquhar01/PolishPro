# **Overview of Template Analysis and Selection**

In this task, I explored various GitHub project templates such as Basic Kanban, Automated Kanban, Bug Triage, and Team Planning, comparing their columns, workflows, automation features, and suitability for Agile methodologies. The goal was to identify the most appropriate template for managing tasks, iterations, and team collaboration, ensuring a smooth workflow for the **PolishPro Nail Salon Booking System** project. Based on this analysis, I selected the **Team Planning** template as it aligns perfectly with our Agile approach, supporting structured task management and iteration tracking.

## 1. Template Analysis and Selection 

### **Comparison of GitHub Project Templates**

| Template Name        | Columns (Workflows)               | Automation Features                    | Suitability for Agile Methodologies |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Basic Kanban**    | To Do, In Progress, Done        | No automation                          | Suitable for simple project tracking |
| **Automated Kanban**| To Do, In Progress, Done        | Auto-moves issues based on status      | Ideal for sprint tracking and automation |
| **Bug Triage**      | New, High Priority, Low Priority, Closed | Auto-labels and categorizes issues | Best for bug tracking and prioritization |
| **Team Planning**   | Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done | Supports iterations and team assignments | Useful for structured Agile team workflows |

## **Chosen Template: Team Planning**
## **Justification:**
- The **Team Planning** template is best suited for our Agile workflow as it supports structured task management with multiple stages (Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done), making it ideal for managing sprints and team collaboration.
- It enables **iteration tracking**, which is essential for breaking down the **PolishPro Nail Salon Booking System** into smaller, manageable tasks for each sprint.
- The **Backlog** column allows us to clearly prioritize tasks for future development, while the **Review** column ensures that tasks are thoroughly tested and reviewed before final completion.
- With **team assignments** supported in this template, each team member can be directly linked to specific tasks, improving collaboration and visibility.
- This template aligns perfectly with the Agile methodology, which we are using for the **PolishPro Booking System**, ensuring continuous improvement, iteration, and efficient sprint planning throughout the development process.
