## Reflection 
Challenges faced in balancing stakeholder 

Balancing the stakeholders of the PolishPro: Nail Salon Booking System was not easy, especially with the small to medium business size. Since there were budget constraints, most of the stakeholders were forced to undertake more than one role, and this made it difficult to understand their roles and relationships in the system. The second difficulty was selecting the key stakeholders because it was not possible to have too many for this business size. I had to prioritize the most important stakeholders while ensuring all the necessary perspectives were covered, which required careful consideration and thought.

Furthermore, communication and decision-making could become an issue due to overlapping responsibilities. For example, the Salon Owner/Manager may need input from both Nail Technicians and the Full Stack Developer, which would require aligning their different perspectives and priorities, potentially taking more time. Additionally, keeping everyone on the same page while avoiding overcomplicating their roles was key to ensuring the project moved forward smoothly. Managing these dynamics was crucial to maintaining efficient progress.
