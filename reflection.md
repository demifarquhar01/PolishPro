# Reflection on Selecting and Customizing the Kanban Template

## Challenges in Choosing and Customizing the Right Template
Picking the right **GitHub project template** for my **2-week sprint** wasnâ€™t as simple as just clicking a button. GitHub offers several templatesâ€”**Basic Kanban, Automated Kanban, Bug Triage, and Team Planning**â€”and after some consideration, I went with **Team Planning**. Itâ€™s structured enough for Agile workflows and makes task management more efficient.

### Customization Challenges
The default setup was a bit too basic, with just **To Do, In Progress, and Done** columns. That wasnâ€™t enough to reflect my development process, so I made a few key adjustments:
- **Backlog**: A place to store all user stories before theyâ€™re assigned to a sprint.
- **Testing**: To verify that features are working before they move forward.
- **Blocked**: A column to track anything preventing progress.
- **Review**: A final checkpoint before marking tasks as "Done."

Balancing **workflow complexity and efficiency** was a challenge. Too many stages would slow things down, but too few could lead to unfinished or low-quality work. I had to strike the right balance to keep the process structured yet smooth.

Another limitation? **GitHub lacks built-in automation compared to tools like Jira**. While Jira can move tasks automatically based on conditions (e.g., transitioning an issue to "In Progress" when assigned), GitHub requires manual updatesâ€”unless I set up custom scripts. Itâ€™s a bit more hands-on but still manageable.

## Comparing GitHub, Trello, and Jira
## Comparison of GitHub Projects, Trello, and Jira

GitHub Projects, Trello, and Jira each offer unique features suited for different aspects of project management, particularly in software development and Agile environments. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison of each tool based on various key factors:

### 1. Best For
- **GitHub Projects** is ideal for developers working within the GitHub ecosystem. It allows easy task management alongside code development and integrates well with GitHub Issues. It's best for small to medium-sized projects where detailed Agile features are not necessary.
  
- **Trello** is perfect for teams looking for a simple, visual task management tool. Itâ€™s great for small projects or teams that need basic task tracking. While it can be adapted for Agile workflows, it doesn't offer built-in sprint reporting, which makes it less ideal for teams needing in-depth Agile management.

- **Jira** is designed for teams that follow Agile methodologies (like Scrum or Kanban). Itâ€™s the most powerful tool for project management, particularly for larger teams that require advanced features like sprint planning, detailed tracking, and comprehensive reporting.

### 2. Customization
- **GitHub Projects** offers basic customization with the ability to organize tasks through columns and labels, but it doesnâ€™t allow for complex workflows or deep customization out of the box. You would need third-party tools or scripts to extend its functionality.

- **Trello** is highly customizable with its drag-and-drop interface and the use of Power-Ups (add-ons). It allows for flexible organization, such as adding custom columns like "Backlog" or "Testing," and can be adapted to suit specific workflows, though not as deeply as Jira.

- **Jira** provides the most advanced customization options. You can create custom workflows, fields, issue types, and automation rules. This level of customization makes Jira suitable for complex projects and teams with specific needs, offering control over almost every aspect of the project management process.

### 3. Agile Support
- **GitHub Projects** supports Agile practices in a basic form, allowing you to organize tasks into sprints or categorize them by status. However, it doesnâ€™t include native Agile features like burndown charts, sprint planning, or backlog management.

- **Trello** can be adapted for Agile workflows with custom board setups. You can use add-ons like the Agile Power-Up to manage sprints and a backlog. However, it lacks built-in features such as sprint planning, velocity tracking, and burndown charts.

- **Jira** excels in Agile project management, offering full support for both Scrum and Kanban methodologies. It provides tools like sprint planning, backlog management, burndown charts, and velocity tracking. Jira is designed for Agile teams and offers detailed insights into sprint performance and project progress.

### 4. Workflow Automation
- **GitHub Projects** has basic automation, such as moving tasks between columns based on their status. While functional, it lacks the ability to set advanced triggers or automation rules like those in Jira.

- **Trello** offers workflow automation through Power-Ups like Butler, which lets you create custom automation rules. You can automate actions like moving tasks between lists or setting reminders for due dates. While this is useful, it doesnâ€™t offer the depth of automation that Jira provides.

- **Jira** offers the most robust automation capabilities, allowing teams to set triggers, automate status changes, and create custom workflows based on specific conditions. This makes it ideal for teams with complex processes or high levels of task dependencies.

### 5. Ease of Use
- **GitHub Projects** is familiar to developers, especially those already using GitHub, and provides a simple task management experience. However, non-developers might find it less intuitive, as itâ€™s not designed with a broader audience in mind.

- **Trello** is incredibly user-friendly with its intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Itâ€™s perfect for teams that need a straightforward task management system. Its simplicity and ease of use make it accessible even for non-technical users.

- **Jira** has a steeper learning curve due to its extensive feature set and advanced configuration options. It can take some time to fully understand how to set up workflows and reports, especially for non-technical users. However, for teams working in Agile environments, the learning curve is worth the investment due to the powerful features it offers.

### 6. Reporting & Insights
- **GitHub Projects** offers basic tracking, such as progress through columns, but lacks built-in reporting tools like sprint velocity or burndown charts. For more detailed insights, third-party tools or manual tracking would be needed.

- **Trello** provides minimal reporting unless you integrate external tools or use Power-Ups. It can track basic progress but doesnâ€™t offer detailed insights like Jiraâ€™s performance metrics.

- **Jira** shines in reporting, offering advanced capabilities like sprint reports, burndown charts, velocity tracking, and more. These reports provide valuable insights into team performance and project health, making it an essential tool for Agile teams that need data-driven decision-making.

### Key Highlights
- **GitHub Projects** is best for developers and small teams looking for an integrated, simple task management tool that ties directly into code. While it lacks advanced reporting and Agile features, itâ€™s great for straightforward task tracking. Customizing the board with extra columns like **Backlog, Testing, Blocked, and Review** made a big difference in keeping tasks organized. It works well for a **small-to-medium-sized project** with a straightforward workflow.

- **Trello** is perfect for teams that need a flexible, easy-to-use tool for task management. It works well for small projects or teams without complex Agile needs. While it can be adapted for Agile, it doesnâ€™t provide the depth of features found in Jira.

- **Jira** is the go-to choice for teams using Agile methodologies, especially those working with larger projects or requiring detailed tracking, reporting, and automation. While it comes with a steeper learning curve, its powerful features make it the best option for managing complex workflows and projects. If you need **detailed sprint analytics or heavy automation**, **Jira would be the better choice**.

Each tool has its strengths, and the best choice depends on the size of the team, the complexity of the project, and the specific needs of the workflow. If you're a developer working within GitHub, GitHub Projects might be enough. For simpler task management, Trello is a great option, and for Agile project management with extensive reporting and customization, Jira is the best choice.

### Overall 
GitHub Projects is well-suited for the PolishPro Nail Salon Booking System. Since it is a small-to-medium-sized project with a straightforward workflow, GitHub Projects allows you to easily track tasks alongside code development. It integrates well with GitHub and provides a simple task management system, making it ideal for developers working on the system. While it lacks advanced Agile features like built-in reporting or sprint analytics, its simplicity and ability to customize columns for task organization, such as Backlog, Testing, Blocked, and Review, make it a good fit for this type of project.

In the end, tweaking the **Team Planning** template helped me build a more Agile-friendly workflow while keeping things simple and developer-focused. ðŸš€
