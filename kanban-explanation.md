# Kanban Board for PolishPro Nail Salon Booking System

## What is a Kanban Board?
A Kanban Board is a simple yet effective way to manage workflows by visually tracking tasks as they move through different stages of a project. Itâ€™s organized into columnsâ€”typically "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done"â€”so teams can easily see what needs to be worked on, whatâ€™s in progress, and whatâ€™s completed.

Each task is represented as a card that moves from one column to the next as work progresses. This clear visual structure helps teams stay organized and focused.

To keep things running smoothly, a Kanban Board also limits the number of tasks in progress at any given time, preventing work from piling up and ensuring a steady, manageable workflow. This approach helps teams work more efficiently, avoid bottlenecks, and maintain a consistent pace.

## How Our Kanban Board Works
1. **Visualizing Workflow**  
   Our Kanban board is structured with multiple columns that represent different stages of task progression:
   
   - **Backlog**: Contains all created tasks that are yet to be prioritized or scheduled for a sprint.
   - **To Do**: Lists tasks that have been prioritized and are ready to be worked on.
   - **In Progress**: Contains tasks that are actively being developed.
   - **Blocked**: Captures tasks that are unable to proceed due to dependencies, missing requirements, or other issues.
   - **Testing**: Ensures that completed tasks go through proper quality assurance before progressing. This phase also ensures that quality standards are met before moving forward.
   - **Done**: Holds tasks that have successfully passed all stages and are now considered finished.

   This structure provides a clear, real-time overview of where tasks are in the development cycle, ensuring transparency and accountability.

2. **Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP) to Avoid Bottlenecks**  
   A well-functioning Kanban board prevents team members from working on too many tasks simultaneously, which can slow progress and reduce efficiency. To manage this:
   
   - **WIP Limits**: We restrict the number of tasks that can be in the "In Progress" column at any given time to ensure focus and avoid overloading developers.
   - **Blocked Column**: Tasks that cannot proceed are placed here, highlighting critical roadblocks that need immediate attention.
   - **Quality Control Stage (Testing)**: Before moving to "Done," tasks must pass through dedicated testing, ensuring quality standards are met and no defects are introduced into production.

   By implementing these controls, we ensure a steady workflow, reduce task switching, and enhance overall productivity.

3. **Supporting Agile Principles**  
   Our Kanban board aligns with Agile principles by enabling:

-  âœ… **Continuous Delivery**: Tasks flow through Testing before completion, ensuring high-quality deliverables.  
 - âœ… **Flexibility & Adaptability**: The board allows for easy prioritization changes, bug fixes, and feature updates based on feedback.  
 - âœ… **Transparency & Collaboration**: Everyone on the team has visibility into ongoing work, pending tasks, and blockers, fostering better communication.  
 - âœ… **Efficiency & Productivity**: WIP limits and structured workflows help developers stay focused and prevent unnecessary delays.

## Conclusion
By structuring our Kanban board with clearly defined stages, work-in-progress limits, and quality checkpoints, we ensure an optimized workflow that aligns with Agile best practices. This approach enhances team efficiency, improves collaboration, and enables faster delivery of high-quality features for the PolishPro Nail Salon Booking System. ðŸš€
