## ðŸ“Œ Justification for Prioritization

### **Must-have User Stories**
These are fundamental for the system's **core functionality** and **business goals**.

- **US001 (User Registration)**: Without registration, clients cannot book appointments.
- **US002 (User Login)**: Clients need access to manage bookings.
- **US004 (View Services)**: Users must see services before booking.
- **US005 (Book Appointment)**: Core feature, ensuring clients can schedule treatments.
- **US006 (Confirmation Email)**: Users need confirmation to avoid booking uncertainty.
- **US007 (Cancel/Reschedule Appointments)**: Provides flexibility and reduces no-shows.
- **US009 (Technician Viewing Appointments)**: Essential for technicians to prepare.
- **US011 (Manage Scheduling)**: Crucial for business operations to avoid double bookings.

### **Should-have User Stories**
These enhance the **user experience** but do not block system usability.

- **US003 (Password Reset)**: Important for accessibility but not required for initial launch.
- **US008 (Email Reminders)**: Helps reduce missed appointments but is not critical.
- **US010 (Client Preferences for Technicians)**: Improves service quality but can be added later.
- **US012 (Modify Services)**: Important for management but does not impact immediate usability.

### **Could-have User Stories**
These add **extra functionality** but are not a priority.

- **US013 (Manage Email Failures)**: Ensuring email delivery is valuable but not urgent.

### **Wonâ€™t-have User Stories**
These are **out of scope** for this release due to complexity, budget, or priority alignment.

- Social media integrations (Nice but not essential for booking)
- loyalty rewards (Future enhancement)
- Advanced analytics (Future enhancement)
- Rating Reviews (Future enhancement)
These would further enhance usability and customer retention but are not essential for initial deployment.

This backlog ensures that **Must-have features align with PolishProâ€™s success metrics**, particularly **usability, reliability, and operational efficiency**. **Should-have and Could-have features** are scheduled for later phases, balancing **business value and development effort**.

 ## ðŸ“Œ Justification for Prioritization
The prioritization follows the **MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Wonâ€™t-have) framework**, ensuring that critical system functionalities are prioritized while allowing flexibility for future enhancements.  

### **Must-have (Critical for System Functionality, Security, and User Experience)**  
These requirements are essential for the system to function as intended, ensuring usability, accessibility, security, and system stability. Without them, the system would fail to meet stakeholder expectations or legal/compliance standards.  
- **US-014 (WCAG 2.1 Compliance)** â€“ Ensuring accessibility is a **legal and ethical requirement**, making it critical for users with disabilities.  
- **US-015 (Cross-Device Compatibility)** â€“ Given that users will access the system from various devices, responsiveness is essential for usability.  
- **US-016 (Intuitive UI for Clients)** â€“ A poor user experience would lead to low adoption rates, directly impacting business success.  
- **US-018 (Failed Email Logging)** â€“ Essential for troubleshooting and ensuring important communications (e.g., appointment confirmations) are not lost.  
- **US-021 (AES-256 Encryption)** â€“ Required for **data security and compliance** with industry standards. Any breach could lead to legal liabilities and reputational damage.  
- **US-023 (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC)** â€“ Ensures proper access management, preventing unauthorized actions that could compromise the system.  
- **US-024 (Fast Frontend-Backend Interactions)** â€“ Slow performance leads to frustration and system abandonment, making performance a core necessity.  
- **US-025 (99.9% Uptime)** â€“ Since the booking system is business-critical, downtime directly affects revenue and customer satisfaction.  

### **Should-have (Enhances Performance, Maintainability, and Scalability)**  
These requirements are valuable but not immediately necessary. The system can function without them in the initial release, but they provide long-term benefits in terms of growth, efficiency, and automation.  
- **US-017 (API Documentation)** â€“ While essential for long-term development, Agile methodologies emphasize iterative documentation, so initial releases can function without complete API documentation.  
- **US-019 (Concurrent Users Support)** â€“ Scalability is important but not an immediate blocker for launch, as traffic will grow over time.  
- **US-020 (Horizontal Scaling)** â€“ Future-proofing the system is crucial, but initial usage may not require extensive scaling from the start.  
- **US-022 (User Activity Logging)** â€“ While valuable for **security auditing**, itâ€™s not required in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) phase. Logs can be expanded iteratively.  
- **US-026 (CI/CD Automation)** â€“ Automating updates improves stability, but manual deployments can suffice in early stages.  

### **Wonâ€™t-have**  
- Every listed requirement directly impacts.
