# üìù Reflection: Challenges in Prioritization, Estimation, and Agile Alignment  

## üìå Overview  
Working on the **PolishPro: Nail Salon Booking System** solo has been an insightful experience. Without a team to delegate tasks or provide feedback, I had to tackle challenges in **prioritization, estimation, and aligning Agile** with my workflow on my own.  

## üî• Challenges Faced  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Prioritization Struggles**  
One of the biggest hurdles was balancing **business value, technical feasibility, and user expectations**. While some features, like **appointment booking**, were clearly top priority, others‚Äîsuch as **viewing client preferences**‚Äîrequired deeper consideration.  

At first, I thought client preferences might be a **Should-have**, but after revisiting the business needs, I realized it plays a **critical role** in improving customer satisfaction and service quality. Nail technicians need quick access to client history, preferred services, and past appointments to provide **personalized experiences**. Without this, the system wouldn't fully support its intended purpose.  

This made me rethink how I prioritize features‚Äînot just based on core functionality but also on **real business impact**. It reinforced the importance of validating **initial assumptions** and continuously aligning priorities with business goals.  


Additionally, different stakeholders had conflicting priorities.  
- The **Salon Owner** wanted efficient operations (e.g., managing appointment slots).  
- **Clients** valued ease of use (e.g., a simple booking UI).  
- The **IT Administrator** emphasized security and system reliability.  

Aligning these needs meant making trade-offs‚Äîsome features had to be **deprioritized** for the MVP.  

**What Comes First?**  
One major struggle was deciding **what to focus on in Sprint 1**. Since the system required multiple key features‚Äîbooking management, user authentication, email notifications, and more‚Äîit was tempting to start everything at once. But that goes against **Agile principles**, which emphasize **incremental value delivery**.  

At first, I considered building **user authentication** first, but I realized that without a booking system, the app wouldn‚Äôt serve its core purpose. I ultimately decided to **focus Sprint 1 on booking functionality**, ensuring users could schedule appointments and receive confirmations.  

üìù **Lesson Learned:** Prioritization isn‚Äôt just about importance‚Äîit‚Äôs about **what provides early value**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Challenges in Estimation**  
Estimating effort for user stories was trickier than expected.  

**Uncertainty in Complexity:** Some features seemed simple but had hidden complexities. For example, password reset required email validation and security measures, adding unexpected effort.  

**Dependencies Between Features:** Booking an appointment depended on having available services and registered users. If one part was delayed, it affected everything else.  

**Balancing Scope vs. Development Time:** Features like email reminders were valuable but weren‚Äôt essential for launch. Estimating their effort helped decide whether to **include them in Phase 1 or postpone them**.  

Since I was handling both **development and testing**, I had to determine realistic timelines. Some tasks, like setting up the **database schema**, became more complex than expected due to data relationships and optimization needs.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Aligning Agile**  
Agile typically involves team collaboration, stand-ups, and retrospectives. As a **solo developer**, I had to **adapt Agile to my workflow**:  

- Used **GitHub Issues** to track tasks.  
- Created **Milestones** to define sprint goals.  
- Conducted **self-reviews** at the end of each sprint to evaluate progress.  

However, without external feedback, it was easy to **overlook mistakes** or spend too much time on one area. To counter this, I started **reviewing the system from a user‚Äôs perspective** at regular checkpoints.  

**Aligning Stakeholder Needs:**  
- **Iterative Feedback:** Clients and technicians provided feedback, sometimes requiring **mid-sprint changes**. While Agile allows flexibility, **too many changes** disrupted sprint planning.  
- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):** Stakeholders focused on **features**, but **security, scalability, and performance** needed attention too. Tackling NFRs early prevented **technical debt later**.  

---
## üéØ **Final Thoughts**  
- **Trade-offs are necessary**‚Äînot everything can be delivered in the first release.  
- **Estimations improve over time**‚Äîinitial guesses may be off, but experience refines accuracy.  
- **Prioritization should align with business impact**‚Äîdelivering **early value** ensures stakeholders see results faster.  

 Reflecting on this experience, I realize that **structured planning and adaptability** are essential. While challenging, this process has strengthened my ability to balance priorities, make realistic effort estimations, and integrate Agile principles into my workflow. This project will also support my professional growth by enhancing how I approach future projects. üöÄ
