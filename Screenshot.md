### Why This Template Was Chosen
For this project, we selected the Team Planning template as the foundation for our Kanban board. This template includes essential Agile workflow stages such as To Do, In Progress, and Done, which provide a simple yet effective way to track task progress.

We then customized the board by adding additional columns to better align with Agile development practices and improve the efficiency of our PolishPro Nail Salon Booking System. These customizations help ensure a structured approach to task management, quality control, and smooth sprint execution.

### Customization Choices & Justification
To enhance our Agile workflow, the following columns were added:

- **Backlog**  
  Stores all created user stories and tasks that are yet to be prioritized for the sprint.  
  Keeps the board organized and prevents unfinished tasks from cluttering active workflows.

- **To Do (Default Column)**  
  Lists tasks that are planned and ready to be worked on.  
  Ensures clear visibility into upcoming development work.

- **In Progress (Default Column)**  
  Contains tasks that are actively being worked on by team members.  
  Allows the team to track ongoing development work in real-time.

- **Blocked (Custom Column)**  
  Captures tasks that are currently blocked due to dependencies, issues, or missing requirements.  
  Ensures visibility into roadblocks so they can be resolved as quickly as possible.

- **Testing (Custom Column)**  
  Added to align with QA requirements and ensure all features undergo proper validation before deployment.  
  Includes quality checks to ensure the feature is developed in quality before progressing further.

- **Done (Default Column)**  
  Contains tasks that have passed all quality checks and are considered complete.  
  Ensures only properly tested features make it to production.

### Benefits of This Customization
- âœ… Ensures high-quality features through dedicated Testing and quality checks.  
- âœ… Provides clear visibility into task status, blockers, and pending tasks.  
- âœ… Supports Agile principles by enabling continuous improvement and efficient sprint management.  
- âœ… Reduces bottlenecks by identifying blocked tasks early and addressing them proactively.

By structuring the Kanban board this way, we ensure that tasks flow smoothly through different stages while maintaining a focus on quality and efficiency. ðŸš€
