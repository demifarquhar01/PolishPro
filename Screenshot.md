## **Why This Template Was Chosen**  
For this project, we selected the **Team Planning** template as the foundation for our Kanban board. This template includes essential Agile workflow stages such as **To Do, In Progress, and Done**, which provide a simple yet effective way to track task progress.  

We then **customized the board** by adding additional columns to better align with Agile development practices and improve the efficiency of our **PolishPro Nail Salon Booking System**. These customizations help ensure a **structured approach to task management, quality control, and smooth sprint execution**.  

## **Customization Choices & Justification**  

To enhance our Agile workflow, the following columns were added:  

### **1. Backlog**  
- Stores all created user stories and tasks that are yet to be prioritized for the sprint.  
- Keeps the board organized and prevents unfinished tasks from cluttering active workflows.  

### **2. To Do** *(Default Column)*  
- Lists tasks that are planned and ready to be worked on.  
- Ensures clear visibility into upcoming development work.  

### **3. In Progress** *(Default Column)*  
- Contains tasks that are actively being worked on by team members.  
- Allows the team to track ongoing development work in real-time.  

### **4. Blocked** *(Custom Column)*  
- Captures tasks that are currently blocked due to dependencies, issues, or missing requirements.  
- Ensures visibility into roadblocks so they can be resolved as quickly as possible.  

### **5. Testing** *(Custom Column)*  
- Added to align with **QA requirements** and ensure all features undergo proper validation before deployment.  
- Helps prevent defects by requiring thorough testing before progressing to the next stage.  

### **6. Review** *(Custom Column)*  
- In Agile, delivering **high-quality features** is crucial, so this column was added for final approval.  
- Tasks that pass testing are reviewed for code quality, functionality, and compliance before moving to "Done."  

### **7. Done** *(Default Column)*  
- Contains tasks that have passed all quality checks and are considered complete.  
- Ensures only properly tested and reviewed features make it to production.  

## **Benefits of This Customization**  
âœ… **Ensures high-quality features** through dedicated Testing and Review stages.  
âœ… **Provides clear visibility** into task status, blockers, and pending reviews.  
âœ… **Supports Agile principles** by enabling continuous improvement and efficient sprint management.  
âœ… **Reduces bottlenecks** by identifying blocked tasks early and addressing them proactively.  

By structuring the Kanban board this way, we ensure that tasks flow smoothly through different stages while maintaining a focus on quality and efficiency. ðŸš€
