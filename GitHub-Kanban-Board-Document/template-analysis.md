It helps us to plan tasks for future sprints and ensure that the most critical features are developed first. The **Review** column is key to ensuring quality, as it allows for tasks to be thoroughly tested and reviewed before moving to the final stage. This ensures that each feature is properly tested and meets the required standards before being marked as complete.

- **Team Assignments and Collaboration**: This template supports **team assignments**, allowing specific tasks to be directly linked to individual team members. This feature enhances collaboration by clearly identifying who is responsible for what tasks, helping to avoid confusion and ensuring accountability. It improves visibility for both individual tasks and team progress, which is essential for effective communication within the team.

- **Agile Alignment**: The **Team Planning** template aligns perfectly with the **Agile methodology**, which we are using for the **PolishPro Nail Salon Booking System** project. Agile emphasizes continuous iteration, collaboration, and adaptability, and this template supports these principles by facilitating a structured yet flexible approach to managing the project. With built-in support for sprint tracking, team assignments, and task prioritization, this template helps ensure that we can efficiently plan, execute, and review tasks for each sprint, ensuring smooth development and timely delivery of features.

Overall, the **Team Planning** template supports efficient sprint planning, task management, and iteration tracking, making it the ideal choice for our **PolishPro Nail Salon Booking System** project.
