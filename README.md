## From Class Diagrams to Code with All Creational Patterns

### Class Implementation - Language Choice & Design Decisions
### üî∑ Language Choice: Java

I chose **Java** for the implementation of this system due to the following reasons:

- **Object-Oriented Structure:** Java is fully object-oriented, making it an excellent fit for translating UML class diagrams directly into code using encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Strong Typing & Compile-Time Checking:** Java's strict type checking helps prevent common bugs early, which is especially useful for a structured system like a booking platform.
- **Standard Design Pattern Support:** Java makes it easier to implement design patterns such as Factory, Singleton, and Builder, which are used throughout this system for object creation and management.
- **Scalability and Maintainability:** Java applications are easier to maintain and scale. For a medium-sized business like a nail salon, it‚Äôs important to be able to add new features (e.g., loyalty systems, staff rating) without rewriting core logic.
- **Community and Documentation:** Java has a massive developer community, and most issues are well-documented online, which helps speed up development and learning.
- **Maven Support**: Java integrates seamlessly with Maven, which simplifies dependency management, builds, and testing for the system.
  
### üî∑ Key Design Decisions
- **Encapsulation:** All attributes are marked private and accessed via getters/setters to protect data and allow validation logic if needed.
- **Inheritance:** Classes like `Client`, `SalonOwner`, and `NailTechnician` extend from a base `User` class to reduce redundancy.
- **Composition:** The system uses composition for entities like `Appointment`, `Schedule`, and `ClientPreference` to ensure modularity and loose coupling.
- **Error Handling:** Most methods check for `null` inputs or invalid states to make the application more robust.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Each class has a single responsibility (e.g., `ClientPreference` handles only client preferences).

## ‚úÖ Summary of Patterns Applied

- **Simple Factory**  
  The `SimpleFactory` class provides a single method to create different user types (e.g., `Client`, `NailTechnician`), centralizing object instantiation logic.

- **Factory Method**  
  The `UserCreator` interface and its concrete subclasses define how user roles are created, allowing subclasses to decide which type of user to instantiate (e.g., `ClientCreator`, `TechnicianCreator`).

- **Abstract Factory**  
  The `UserFactory` class (with `ConcreteUserFactory`) is used to create families of related user objects (`Client`, `NailTechnician`, `SalonOwner`, `ITAdministrator`) without specifying their exact classes.

- **Builder**  
  The `AppointmentBuilder` allows for flexible construction of complex `Appointment` objects, especially when not all fields are required. This helps avoid telescoping constructors.

- **Prototype**  
  The `Service` class implements the `Cloneable` interface, allowing deep copies of service objects (e.g., duplicating a predefined service package for reuse).

- **Singleton**  
  The `ITAdministrator` class ensures that only a single instance is created and used throughout the application to centralize infrastructure control and system access.

## üìå Justifications

- **Simple Factory:**  
  *Used to centralize and simplify user object creation by exposing a single method that returns different user types.*

- **Factory Method:**  
  *Applied to delegate the instantiation of specific user roles to subclasses, enabling flexibility and adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.*

- **Abstract Factory:**  
  *Used to group and instantiate related objects (various user types) without tightly coupling the code to specific implementations.*

- **Builder:**  
*Used the **Builder** pattern for the `Appointment` class to manage optional parameters like `status` while ensuring required fields such as `appointmentId` and `dateTime` are always provided. This design choice enhances code readability, supports flexible object creation with different configurations, and enforces proper validation and immutability at the time of object construction, making the code more maintainable and robust.*

- **Prototype:**  
  *Implemented in the `Service` class to quickly clone service offerings, avoiding repetitive instantiation logic for similar services.*

- **Singleton:**  
  *Used for `ITAdministrator` to restrict instantiation to a single object, ensuring consistent access to system configuration and monitoring functionalities.*
